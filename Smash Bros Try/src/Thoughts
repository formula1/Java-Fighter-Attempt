How do I want to build Games?

Theres this concept that... "HEY IT WILL BE DIFFERENT EVERYTIME, SO KEEP IT MODULAR!!!"
But theres also the realistic idea of speed and purpose

Speed in terms of development
And speed in terms of processing

Lightweight in terms of download


So, how do I want to build games?
I want to be able to craft entities fixtures simply.
Without the need to do it in java
Similar to HTML except obviously not

I think

<Entity>
	<State>
		<Body>
			<fixture>
			<fixture>
			<fixture>
		</body>
		<Body>
		<Body>
		<Body>
	</state>
	
</Entity>

Thats a good start

However, when it comes down to it, lets look at where I'm going
-Add Graphics-Sometimes associated to body, sometimes associated to fixture, sometimes a gui/background (binds to the camera)
-Playable over the internet, games able to set the number of players they desire
-Have menus as well as the game, So i need a menu renderer of sorts
-Keeping as much stuff in the background as possible while also making sure people have the ability to easily make animations
	and such

-Be able to develop fun games at a fast pace. Using Debug draw at first then adding graphics later
