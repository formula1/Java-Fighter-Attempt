Part of the Issue right now is my lack of organization

1) Player entities and other entities are all pratcically the same

2a) The player entities use a command interface to do its actions
2b) Other entities use an ai to do its actions

3) Skeletons/attackboxes should be seperate from the entity itself

4) I want to start with something simple, and though I have a bunch of advanced stuff available to me at this point
	I need to take a step back and put simple on first

5a) Level is an aspect I need to do
5b) Entity is an aspect I need to do
	-Entity actions
5c) Command is an aspect I need to do
5d) Menus/worlds is an aspect I need to do

One thing at a time....
